Implementing a programming language and a theorem prover
========================================================
Welcome to the repository of my second Bachelor's thesis. I worked on this in order to improve my GPA over my first Bachelor's thesis.

Currently, the only supported language is Macedonian, but feel free to fork and translate it to other languages.

Installation setup:

1. Update brew and install pandoc: `brew update && brew install pandoc`
2. Install mactex from https://www.tug.org/mactex/
3. Run `./build.sh` to build the thesis

This thesis is dedicated to my family, especially my wife Dijana, and our kids.
